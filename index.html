      <div class="feed">
      <a> Will there ever be a point when the innovations of the website begins to morph in an almost unrecognizable and completely different platform? <br><br> Is a new internet-like innovation possible to be introduced, beating out the ever increasing progress that our current internet's technologies are capable of? <br><br> Can society ever forget/break out of their tendency to judge the classic html style for sites?<br><br> Is there a potential reality where the internet as a whole refuses to reflect society, becoming its own entity towards socio-economic and political spectrums?<br><br> Striving to create experience and engagement online seems to always project in a more physical way but end up developing in a more graphical, technological way. Why is it that we fantasize for technologies such as flying cars or holograms phones but chose to progress these realities in a digital manner such as augmented reality?<br><br> As technology becomes smaller and smarter, why do we not move backwards in our technology rather than simply adding padding or abstractions? It reminds me of the trends in photography, as digital photo advanced to capture clearer and more powerful images, we see people not only editing to mimic film (sort of like adding padding in order to move backwards) but they also have been simply switching back to old technologies and cameras to create that look.<br><br>When did we as a society move our stances on data mining from fantasizing about a world catered to ourselves, to a state of fear for our identities being vulnerable in order to create such tech? <br><br> Is there truly an external threat with the information being taken online versus what was accessible in the physical world? Specifically to the average human.<br><br> Can we ever go back? Can we ever eliminate this threat of data security and online presence as a whole?How has an objective presence that technology brings into our lives affected our ability to socialize and express emotion? Has it or has it not?<br><br>What is the dynamic between benefit and manipulation in our relationship with technology? Is it possible for us to manipulate technology or is that simply manipulating ourselves?<br><br>Is there any possibility to humanize the online experience in an ethical way? <br><br>The glitch is not only saved for the avant garde, and in that case how do we treat its representations in mainstream aesthetics and its resurgence?<br><br> Why has the meme gained the representation and portrayal that it has now in society, and what effect does it's usage have on its aesthetic/vice versa?<br><br>How does the discussion of the factory and the museum affect not only the consumption of art but also the status of the artist creating for exhibition?Is it possible to execute storytelling from multiple genuine perspectives?<br><br>To what extent can technology have an impact on ideology? <br><br>We see that the polar divide in political parties may have been stemmed from algorithmic media, but what about long term impacts on trends like cancel culture and online activism?<br><br>Will development in technology always be considered fantasy? Will we every be satisfied in how technology had developed?
