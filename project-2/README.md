This is the NARCISSIST'S CHROME EXTENSION, a browser extension made for those who love staring at their own little windows of themselves on zoom, 
and crave that ability for self admiration when they are distracted during class on their laptops. With this extension, the camera turns on just like on zoom but 
rather than being confined to a small window, your face is projected as a watermark on the entire screen so eady viewing while multitasking.
